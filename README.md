# gRNA_environment

Analysis pipeline to assess the environment around a genomic location based on a combination of datasets. 

cell-type: RPE-1 cells

### Background
this dataset


#### Datasets used




### Analysis part 1: Run the gRNA info script
Aim: For a table of gRNAs, this script will output tables containing the information of all marks included in the analysis within a user-defined window. 

### Analysis part 2: Run the gRNA filter script
Aim: based on user-defined adaptations, filter gRNAs using the output file for gRNAinfo.
